# Code book for the tidy UCI HAR Dataset #

### What does the script file *run_analysis.R* do? ###
- It binds together the files with all the measurements, subjects and activity codes and creates two data frames (*train* and *test*) for the two different subject groups.
- It binds together the rows of the two dataframes and creates the data frame *my_data*.
- It adds column names to the data frame *my_data*.
- It recreates *my_data* by extracting only the measurements on the mean and the standard deviation for each measurement.
- It replaces the activity codes by descriptive activity names.
- It makes the variable names error proof for further analysis by removing dashes and brackets.
- It puts the variable names in CamelCase format for better readabilty.
- It replaces the starting 't' in the variable names by 'time' and the starting 'f' by 'frequency'.
- It replaces the text 'BodyBody' in some of the variable names by 'Body'.
- It groups the data from *my_data* by subject and activity and takes the average of each variable. The result is assigned to a new data frame called *my_final_data*
