# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

The script file *run_analysis.R* in this repository can be used to create a single tidy data set from the data in the UCI HAR Dataset.

In the file *CodeBook.md* you will find a description of all the variables in the tidy data set and of what the script does exactly.


### Steps to follow to run the script ###
- Download the [zip file][1] with the data set.
- Unzip the zip file and make sure that you keep the original folder structure.
- In R (Studio) use the setwd() command to set the working directory to the UCI HAR Dataset directory where you unzipped all the files.
- Copy the file run_analysis.R to your local computer.
- In R (Studio) use the source() command to run the script file run_analysis.R.
